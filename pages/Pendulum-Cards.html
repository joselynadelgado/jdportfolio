    <h4> I was tasked to create something inspired by the Long-case clock I saw at the Victoria and Albert Museum. White doing research, I found that playing cards have a lot of connections with clocks and time. After discovering these connections, I decided to create a deck of cards inspired by the design of the long-case clock, as well as different forms of time.
