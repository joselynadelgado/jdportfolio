<h2> Hi! I'm Jojo. </h2>

  <p style="font-size:15pt">    
I am an emerging graphic designer with a focus in print publications. I've received a BFA from the University of Connecticut. I also studied design internationally at Central Saint Martins in London. <br><br>
I’m passionate about creating playful and interactive designs as a way to keep the work fun and engaging. I believe the world is heading towards a direction of modern, homogeneous designs. I'm eager to create work expanding beyond that direction, the benefit being more unique work being put out into the world. 
Additionally to print, I’ve been able to gain experience in other areas of design, such as industrial design, coding, and motion graphics. <br><br>
I love to learn and am currently seeking project based or full time work. If you are looking for a skilled and enthusiastic designer, please feel free to reach out. Thanks for looking at my portfolio.
