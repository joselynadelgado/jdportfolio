<h2> Hi! I'm Jojo. </h2>

  <p style="font-size:15pt">    
I am a graphic designer based in CT. I've received my BFA from the University of Connecticut. I also studied design internationally at <br> Central Saint Martins in London. <br><br>
I’m passionate about creating playful and interactive designs as a way to keep the work fun and engaging. I’ve been able to gain experience in many areas of design, including publication design, industrial design, coding, and motion graphics. <br><br>
I love to take on new challenges and am currently seeking project based or full time work. If you are looking for a skilled and enthusiastic designer, please feel free to reach out. Thanks for looking at my portfolio.
