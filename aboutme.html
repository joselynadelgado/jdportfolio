  <b> Hi! I'm Jojo. </b>
<br><br>
I am a graphic design student from the University of Connecticut, however, I am currently studying abroad in London and attending Central Saint Martins to further my design degree. I love to learn and take on new creative opportunities, so if you are looking for a skilled and enthusiastic designer please feel free to reach out. Thanks for looking at my portfolio. </p></td>
