<h2> Hi! I'm Jojo. </h2>
  <p>
    I am a graphic design student studying at the University of Connecticut. Additionally, I have had the opportunity to study abroad in London at Central Saint Martins to further my design degree. Lately, Iâ€™ve been really interested in exploring more tactile and interactive aspects in graphic design. I love bringing together different elements into a 3D space. I love to learn and take on new creative opportunities, so if you are looking for a skilled and enthusiastic designer please feel free to reach out. Thanks for looking at my portfolio.
